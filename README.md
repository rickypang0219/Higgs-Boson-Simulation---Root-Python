# ROOT-Python
This repository demonstrates how to do fitting without using pyROOT or ROOT library. As the installation of pyROOT or ROOT 
is difficult for someone who do not have knowledge in using command or terminal. Thus, I write these programs to do fitting without
using these library. Besides, when we do parameters estimation, we use Pymc3 to do bayesian analysis to find them out. Pymc3 is a 
powerful tool in data analysis and bayesian analysis. I hihgly recommend you to learn it!
